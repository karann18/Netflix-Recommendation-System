# Netflix Recommendation System

## Overview
This project builds a machine learning-based recommendation system to suggest Netflix movies based on genre, cast, theme, duration and other factors. It aims to improve user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of Netflix movie dataset.
- Feature engineering using genre, cast, and theme metadata.
- Machine learning model to recommend top 10 movies.
- Evaluation of recommendation accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, Tf-idf
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Project Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on movie features.
3. Feature extraction and encoding for ML.
4. Model training and testing.
5. Generating personalized movie recommendations.

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook step-by-step to see data cleaning, modeling, and recommendations.
- Customize the input preferences (genre, cast, theme) to get different recommendations.

## Status
âœ… Completed

## Future Improvements
- Deploy as a web app for interactive user input.
- Integrate user ratings for improved recommendations.
- Enhance model with collaborative filtering techniques.
